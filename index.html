              The Color Flipper project generates a random hex color and applies
              it as the background color when a button is clicked. A hex color
              starts with a `#` followed by six characters chosen from the set
              `0-9` and `A-F`, which represent valid hexadecimal digits. To
              create this, a string containing all valid hex characters is
              defined, and a variable is initialized with `#` to start building
              the color. Using a loop that runs six times, one random character
              is picked in each iteration by generating a random index with
              `Math.floor(Math.random() * hex.length)` and appending the
              corresponding character to the color string. Once all six
              characters are added, the final hex color (like `#A3F2C1`) is
              returned. This color is then used to update the page’s background
              using `document.body.style.backgroundColor`. An event listener is
              attached to a button so that this entire process is triggered each
              time the button is clicked. .

            <p>
              The Digital Clock project displays the current time on the webpage
              and updates it every second. It relies on the built-in `Date`
              object in JavaScript, which provides the current system time. The
              `Date` object methods like `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, and
              `getSeconds()` are used to extract individual components of the
              time. To make the clock update in real-time, the `setInterval()`
              function is used to repeatedly execute a function every 1000
              milliseconds (1 second). Inside this function, the current time is
              retrieved, formatted (optionally using `padStart()` to ensure
              two-digit display like `09` instead of `9`), and then updated in
              the DOM by modifying the `innerText` or `textContent` of a
              specific element. This process continues indefinitely, keeping the
              clock live and accurate.

            <p>
              In this project, I demonstrated a basic method of purifying
              seawater through distillation. The process began with collecting
              seawater, which was then placed in a pressure cooker to be boiled.
              The use of a pressure cooker allowed for faster heating and
              efficient generation of water vapor. As the seawater boiled, the
              resulting steam was directed through a condenser. The condenser
              cooled the vapor back into liquid form, effectively separating
              pure water from salts and other impurities. The condensed water
              collected at the end of the setup was clean and free from the
              contaminants present in seawater, showcasing a simple yet
              effective method of water purification using heat and
              condensation.<br /><br />

            I led a team that successfully advanced to the national level of
            Smart India Hackathon (SIH) with our innovative project on
            developing an Artificial Heart. Our model aimed to replicate the
            natural pumping mechanism of the human heart and introduced an
            intelligent system where the heartbeat could adapt dynamically based
            on signals from the brain. The core concept was inspired by
            Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, allowing real-time
            adjustments in heartbeat patterns according to neural activity — a
            futuristic approach to making artificial organs more adaptive and
            responsive. We began by clearing the intra-college round, where I
            was responsible for team coordination, technical planning, and
            aligning our presentation and prototype. Our model generated strong
            interest for its blend of biomedical and AI-driven innovation. While
            we qualified for the national round, we were unable to proceed to
            the finals. The main challenges we faced were the lack of detailed
            medical validation — specifically expert advice from cardiologists
            and neurologists — and the high cost and limited accessibility of
            reliable BCI hardware. Despite these limitations, the project was a
            great learning experience in leadership, biomedical engineering
            concepts, interdisciplinary collaboration, and navigating the
            challenges of high-stakes innovation under time constraints.
